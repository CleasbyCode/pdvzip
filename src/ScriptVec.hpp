/* 
Vector "ScriptVec" (see function "buildScript" in the main pdvzip.cpp file). 
ScriptVec stores the shell/batch script used for extracting and opening the zipped media file.

This barebones script is only about 300 bytes, with a maxiumum size of 750 bytes. 
The buildScript function will insert additional filenames, app+arg strings & other 
required script commands, depending on media type.

Script supports both Linux & Windows. 

The completed script will unzip the media file from the PNG image & attempt to open/play/run (depending on file type)
the in-zip media file using an application command based on a matched file extension. 
If no match found, defaulting to the operating system making the choice, if possible. 

The completed script will later be inserted after the PLTE chunk of the PNG image (which is stored in the vector "ImageVec")
